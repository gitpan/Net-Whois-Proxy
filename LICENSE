OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH FPSN.NET OR OTHER PARTY HAS ADVISED AGAINST

under this Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may be

all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any

modifications or work under the terms of Section 9 above.

11.  Utilization.  A program that contains no derivative of any portion of
the "Software", but is designed to work with the "Software" by being compiled
or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Software". Such a work,
in isolation, is not a derivative work of the "Software", and therefore falls
outside the scope of this License.  However, linking a "work that uses the Software"
with the "Software" that creates an executable that is a derivative of the
"Software"  (because it contains portions of the Original "Software"), rather 
than a "work that uses the Software". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 9 states terms for distribution of such executables.
